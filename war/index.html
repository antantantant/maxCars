                        The complexity of engineering systems requires design solutions be searched from 
                        large sets of candidates, with expensive evaluations of each sampled design. Speeding up the search 
                        would enable more efficient material synthesis, vehicle energy management, and topology design, among many                         other design applications. 
                        Human computation - incorporating crowd intelligence in computation - has shown promise in solving 
                        optimization problems such as <a class="links" href="http://fold.it">protein folding</a>, <a class="links" href="http://eterna.cmu.edu">RNA synthesis</a> and gene segmentation, due to superior 
                        capability of human brain at spatial reasoning and pattern recognition. Our projects evaluate the 
                        utility of human computation in solving engineering design problems that are challenging for existing 
                        computation methods.<br><br>

                        While the challenge of aggregating crowd responses has long 
                        been studied, existing crowdsourcing tasks are often natural to human beings (e.g., image tagging),
                         allowing statistical assumptions to be effective (e.g., responses are randomly distributed around the truth).
                         The challenge with design evaluation tasks is that participants without proper knowledge can be 
                        biased towards the same wrong answer, leading to the failure of statistical models.
                         This poses new challenges on design crowdsourcing:	
                        How should the human evaluation process be modeled?
                        What crowd information shall we collect besides the evaluations? 
    <!--                    How shall we filter the crowd? 
                        What type of evaluation tasks can be reliably crowdsourced? -->

                        Teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been suggested as sensor platforms for disaster victim 
                        search systems used shortly after natural disasters such as an earthquake or tsunami.  Previous efforts 
                        have used UAVs equipped with video cameras for the disaster information gathering stage, with the 
                        information processing stage performed by either a single human operator or a victim detection computer 
                        vision algorithm.  This project extends these efforts by investigating how a large and distributed "crowd"
                         of search volunteers and professionals may augment the information processing stage by helping search 
                         video feeds for disaster victims.<br>

                        In this study we try to understand how much consumers would be willing to pay for changes in car styling.
                        Quantifying consumer preferences with respect to product geometric representation allows us 
                        to choose design solutions that meet consumer preferences as well as engineering and manufacturing
                        feasibility. Our project currently focuses on developing active learning techniques to efficiently 
                        learning from consumers through limited interactions.<br>
