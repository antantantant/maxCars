				<a class="highlight_font">Design Preference Elicitation</a><br>
				"What kind of cars do you like?" The answer lies in the rich interaction data from human and computers. 
				We develop interaction methods to elicit preferred designs from users. 
				Technically, the research contains three components: 1) Learning interaction data to model user preferences, 
				2) Proposing new designs to optimize the learned model from 1), and 3) Improving 2) by using crowd interaction data.

				<a class="highlight_font">Structured Design Representation</a><br>
				Structured representation has been used in many evolutionary computation case studies. 
				Such evolutionary schemes have the strength of exploration but lacks ability of learning. 
				My interest is to investigate learning methods on structured data and apply them to enhance the evolution.
				<br><br>
				<em>Ongoing project: Hybrid electric vehicle transmission configuration design (with Alparslan Emrah Bayrak)</em><br>
				<p>Current HEV transmission incorporates control of multiple modes (clutch engagements) to achieve high fuel 
				economy during a drive cycle. Designing an HEV transmission configuration (a set of modes) can be intriguing since not only the
				modes need to be determined, i.e., the connection of the engine, motors and planetary gears, but also
				the optimal control policy needs to be derived for each	set of modes. We develop an automation framework to 
				search for the optimal transmission configuration based on the given vehicle and drive cycle specifics. 
				<br><br>
				There are three core components of the project: 1) We developed a systematic way to enumerate all 
				physically feasible transmission modes with the given engine, motors and planetary gears. 2) The vehicle model
				is then built connecting the transmission with other vehicle components including engine, wheels, battery pack and others.
				With a set of modes and a given drive cycle, an optimal control policy is developed to balance SOC and minimize fuel consumption.
				3) An optimization algorithm is used to search for a near-optimal configuration based on 1) and 2).

				<a class="highlight_font">Crowdsourcing for Design Solutions (with Alex Burnap)</a><br>
				Designs can be proposed and evaluated by a crowd.
				But what are the game rules in crowdsourcing for a design solution?
