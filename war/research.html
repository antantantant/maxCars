				<a class="highlight_font">Hybrid powertrain architecture design (with Alparslan Emrah Bayrak)</a><br>
				<p>For a system with two motors and two planetary gears, <a class="links" href="resource/RenPapers/idetc2013b.pdf">
				our previous research</a> showed that a thousand 
				feasible configurations (driving modes) exist. As a powertrain may consist of multiple configurations 
				(such as in Chevy Volt), this large number of candidate configurations will make the search of an optimal 
				powertrain intractable. Existing studies often restrict the space for architecture search based on human 
				experience and rules, excluding chances for discovering innovative designs. 
				<br><br>
				Learning from existing 
				configurations to form better search heuristics is therefore desired in such engineering tasks. While the 
				idea already exists, e.g., in response surface methods, the particular difficulty here is that 
				configurations are often represented as graphs (e.g., a powertrain configuration is commonly represented 
				as a bond graph). Successful learning from graphical data requires a problem-specific extraction of graph 
				features, on top of the large collection of graph properties.

				<a class="highlight_font">Learning from crowd evaluations (with Alex Burnap)</a><br><br>
				Learning from people has always been a challenge due to noisy human responses. 
				In some cases, this is due to people's different level of understanding, e.g., whether 
				people can evaluate building layouts correctly depends on their experience in this 
				design topic; in other cases, it could be their own preferences that lead to different 
				evaluations on the same design. For example, <a class="links" href="resource/RenPapers/iced2013.pdf">
				my previous study</a> showed that when presented 
				a pair of car designs and asked "which car looks safer",  half of the participants voted 
				for the "stream-lined" design while the other half for the boxy one. 
				<br><br>
				Such differences in 
				knowledge or preference could be explained by demographic background of people or 
				identified through their social interactions including evaluations on other design 
				topics. The key here is the development of learning algorithms that can extract 
				high-level information to better explain the observations from the massive joint data of 
				designs, people profiles and interactions. Existing feature extraction methods such as 
				sparse-coding and restricted Boltzmann machines will be investigated.

				<br>
				This is an experiment where I tested 1) if there is anyway to automate designs according
				to users' preference, avoiding the slow pace of evolutionary algorithms, 2) how complicated
				a 3D modeling code is.

				This is an webGL implementation of Karl Sims' early work, but needs more polish. 
				It generates random tree representations of animations and burns your GPU. 
				Refresh the page to see something new.
				<br><br>
				You will probably see a few interesting things but most of them are nonsense. 
				Question: How can we automatically generate animations that make sense?
